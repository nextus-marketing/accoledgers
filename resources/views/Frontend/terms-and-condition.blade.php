                        </br>
                        <p>The Service is provided “AS IS” and “AS AVAILABLE” without warranties of any kind.</p>

                        <p>The Company and its Affiliates disclaim all warranties, including implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement, and any warranties arising from course of dealing or usage.</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>The Service may not meet Your expectations.</li>
                            <li>The Service may be interrupted or error-prone.</li>
                            <li>The information provided may not be accurate or current.</li>
                            <li>The Service or its servers may contain harmful components such as viruses or malware.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>Some jurisdictions do not allow certain warranty exclusions, so parts of this section may not apply to You.</p>

                        <h5 class="text-anime-style-3">Governing Law</h5>
                        </br>
                        <p>The laws of New Jersey, United States, govern these Terms and Your use of the Service, except for conflict-of-law rules.</p>

                        <h5 class="text-anime-style-3">Disputes Resolution</h5>
                        </br>
                        <p>If You have any dispute or concern, You agree to attempt resolving it informally by contacting the Company first.</p>

                        <h5 class="text-anime-style-3">For European Union (EU) Users</h5>
                        </br>
                        <p>If You are a consumer in the EU, You benefit from any mandatory provisions of the law of the country in which You reside.</p>

                        <h5 class="text-anime-style-3">United States Legal Compliance</h5>
                        </br>
                        <ul>
                            <li>You are not located in a country under US government embargo.</li>
                            <li>You are not listed on any US government prohibited or restricted parties list.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h5 class="text-anime-style-3">Severability and Waiver</h5>
                        </br>
                        <p>If any provision of these Terms is found unenforceable, it will be modified to reflect the original intent. The rest of the Terms will remain in effect.</p>

                        <h6>Waiver</h6>
                        </br>
                        <p>Failure to enforce a right or provision does not waive that right. A waiver of one breach does not waive subsequent breaches.</p>

                        <h5 class="text-anime-style-3">Translation Interpretation</h5>
                        </br>
                        <p>If these Terms have been translated, the English version will prevail in case of disputes.</p>

                        </br>
